# ChessAnalysis
This repository contains the result of my project for the Data Science course during the 5th semester of my Computer Science bachelor's degree (SUPSI)

I do suggest to look at the final result from [here](https://nbviewer.org/github/dlwlsns/ChessAnalysis/blob/main/chess.ipynb?flush_cache=true). This will include the Plotly graphical result.
